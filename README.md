## üìí Project Purpose

Presently, many modern-day Random Number Generation (RNG) programs do not generate truly randomized numbers, rather they generate pseudorandom numbers determined through specified algorithms.
  
At the same time, current True Random Number Generation (TRNG) programs utilize techniques such as measuring the fluctuations of voltage in order to generate truly random numbers, but are not easily accessible for coding projects.
  
This project aims to resolve both of those issues by using the properties of [Quantum Superposition](https://www.ibm.com/topics/quantum-computing)  alongside IBM's quantum computers in order to generate truly random numbers that can be easily integrated with other coding projects.

## üìñ About
Random Number Generation (RNG) program that uses Quantum Superposition in order to achieve True Random Number Generation that can be integrated with other coding projects.

For this project it is recommended to use one of IBM's Quantum computers instead of a simulator in order to generate truly random numbers, however for testing purposes the [QASM Simulator](https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.providers.aer.QasmSimulator.html#qasmsimulator) is the most accurate and similar to a real-life Quantum Simulator and is used as a proof of concept.


## üñ•Ô∏è Required Environment Installations

  - [`Juypter_Notebook_Quantum_Number_Generator_1-6_Multi_QASM.ipynb`](https://github.com/Jawwad-Javeed/Quantum_Random_Number_Generator/blob/main/Juypter_Notebooks_Quantum_Random_Number_Generator/Juypter_Notebook_Quantum_Number_Generator_1-6_Multi_QASM.ipynb) uses the QASM simulator alongside multiple Qubits and Gates in order to reduce any potential quantum noise effects on the qubit measurements; the function `Generate()` is then utilized to output a completely randomized number from 1-6.
 
    - This program results in the qubits being in either |+> or |-> basis, unlike [`Juypter_Notebook_Quantum_Number_Generator_1-6_QASM.ipynb`](https://github.com/Jawwad-Javeed/Quantum_Random_Number_Generator/blob/main/Juypter_Notebooks_Quantum_Random_Number_Generator/Juypter_Notebook_Quantum_Number_Generator_1-6_QASM.ipynb),which has qubits in the |+> state before measurement.

## üìù Notes
- ### Juypter Notebook

  - Activate following code in Juypter notebook files in order to graph Qubit Bloch spheres:

```
qc.save_statevector()
qobj=assemble(qc)
result=sim.run(qobj).result().get_statevector()
plot_bloch_multivector(result)
``` 

- ### Python 
  - Import either `QASM_Generator()` , `Multi_QASM_Generator()`, or `Binomial_Distribution_Counter_Generate()` from [`Python_Quantum_Number_Generator_1-6_QASM.ipynb`](https://github.com/Jawwad-Javeed/Quantum_Random_Number_Generator/blob/main/Python_Quantum_Random_Number_Generator/Python_Quantum_Number_Generator_1-6_QASM.py), [`Python_Quantum_Number_Generator_1-6_Multi_QASM.ipynb`](https://github.com/Jawwad-Javeed/Quantum_Random_Number_Generator/blob/main/Python_Quantum_Random_Number_Generator/Python_Quantum_Number_Generator_1-6_Multi_QASM.py) or [`Python_Quantum_Number_Generator_Binomial_Distribution_Counter_1-6_QASM.ipynb`](https://github.com/Jawwad-Javeed/Quantum_Random_Number_Generator/blob/main/Python_Quantum_Random_Number_Generator/Python_Quantum_Number_Generator_Binomial_Distribution_Counter_1-6_QASM.py) respectively.
